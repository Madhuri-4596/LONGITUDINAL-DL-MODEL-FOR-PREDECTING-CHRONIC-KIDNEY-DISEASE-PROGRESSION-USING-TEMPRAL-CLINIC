# Longitudinal DL Model for Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease Progression Using Temporal Clinic Data

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project aims to build a longitudinal deep learning model that can predict the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using temporal clinical data. The model leverages sequences of patient records over time to make more accurate and personalized predictions.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview
- Type: Deep Learning (e.g., LSTM, GRU, Transformer)
- Data: Temporal clinical datasets (lab results, vitals, etc.)
- Goal: Predict progression stage or risk level over time

## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline
- Longitudinal sequence modeling
- Performance evaluation (Accuracy, AUC, Precision/Recall)
- Visualization of predictions
